## Features

- File .txt as __BBDD__ for information about ubication, color, and Time-GPT
- Control for __user technical__ through UI of QT Creator
- Serial data for 9600 baudios
- Sensor color with output __PWM__

## Structure
 
For a legibility from development, this proyect is structured in 2 parts

- __Final Proyect__: Containt the UI of proyect

- __Time_Driver__: Containt functions that configure the driver of micro-controller


## Development

The languages used are:

- C embebbed
- C++
- OOP (Oriented-Object Programming)
